                In this assignment, I learned about the Skeleton Framework and using it to create a resume in a responsive format. There were advantages and disadvantages to using the Skeleton framework. Using of skeleton framework helps me to understand the gird system and how i can manipulate the grid system as it was my first experience with this framework. I also had to familiarize myself with the css in order to understand how the html was stylized. In some way it looked easy in a way that i had less control because of the already existing code. I can say that the advantage is that to get yourself familiar with grid system and its precoded stylings. Overall, In the end i would say that using this framework is beneficial for website creation as it is better than many other tools and frameworks.

                <h2 class="section-title">Flexbox Framework Usage</h2>
                In this assignment, I learned about flexbox framework and followed a tutorial in which a responsive website was created. Using the flexbox makes it easy to create layouts for different sized devices and screens. I didnt have to use lots of code in terms of making it responsive for every screen resolution. I would definitely choose flexbox over skeleton framework because of its simplicity and flexibility.
